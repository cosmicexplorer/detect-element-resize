detect-element-resize
=====================

This is an [npm package](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/what-is-npm) for a javascript library to detect when an element on the page changes its size. This repo is a very thin wrapper over [this excellent bit of code](https://github.com/sdecima/javascript-detect-element-resize) by [Sebastián Décima](https://github.com/sdecima), with some modifications.
