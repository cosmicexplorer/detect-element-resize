[This issue](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/detect-element-resize/issues/2) describes a licensing mistake made when first adapting the MIT-licensed code, which has since been resolved. Please [comment on that issue](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/detect-element-resize/issues/2), [make another one](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer/detect-element-resize/issues/new), or [contact me](https://github.com/cosmicexplorer) if you believe the terms of the license are being violated in any way.
